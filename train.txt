Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.
Where?
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
hey.  Great show, huh?

Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .
What?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But -- who -- what --?
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.
Where?
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
hey.  Great show, huh?

Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .
What?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But -- who -- what --?
